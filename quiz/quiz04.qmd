## Question 1

Consider the proof below.

Assume $(x + y)^{N-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \binom{N-1}{i} x^i y^{N - 1 - i}$. Then,
$$
\begin{aligned}
(x + y)^N &= (x + y) (x + y)^{N-1} \\
 &= (x + y) \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \binom{N-1}{i} x^i y^{N - 1 - i} \\
 &= \left( \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \binom{N-1}{i} x^{i+1} y^{N - 1 - i} \right)
  + \left( \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \binom{N-1}{i} x^i y^{N - i} \right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

In the first sum, re-index with $j = i + 1$. In the second sum, substitute $j = i$.
This gives
$$
\begin{aligned}
(x + y)^N &=
    \left( \sum_{j=1}^{N} \binom{N-1}{j-1} x^j y^{N - j} \right)
  + \left( \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \binom{N-1}{j} x^j y^{N - j} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

\bigskip

Next, separate out the last term from the first sum, and the first term
from the second sum.
$$
\begin{aligned}
(x + y)^N &=
    \left( \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} \binom{N-1}{j-1} x^j y^{N - j} \right)
  + \left( \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} \binom{N-1}{j} x^j y^{N - j} \right) \\
  &\quad + \binom{N-1}{N-1} x^N y^{N-N}
  + \binom{N}{0} x^0 y^N \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Which step of the proof above is not well justified
or contains an error?


*Remark*: On the exam, you will not be asked to spot errors in a proof.
Rather, you'd be asked to provide fully justified proofs.


## Question 2

In the Card Drawing tutorial, suppose you draw another set of 8 cards before putting the cards from the first round back into the deck. 
Derive the pmf for the number of non-face
cards that would be in this second set of cards.

Define the variables as follows:

\( N \), number of cards in the deck

\( K \), number of non-face cards in the deck

\( n_i \), number of cards drawn in the \(i\)th round

\( k_i \), number of non-face cards drawn in the \(i\)th round
