## Problem

You are measuring spike trains from a neuron, and you measured
the number of spikes observed in multiple experiments, each with
different recording time intervals.

You recorded the following results:

| time interval (min) | number of spikes        |
|:-------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|         1           |            6            |
|         1           |            8            |
|         1           |            2            |
|         2           |           11            |
|         2           |           14            |
|         3           |           14            |
|         3           |           17            |

You performed the experiment again after treating the neuron with
a compound.

| time interval (min) | number of spikes        |
|:-------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|         1           |            1            |
|         2           |            3            |
|         4           |            6            |
|         5           |            9            |


What is the spiking rate per minute
before and after compound treatment?


## Tasks

1. Consider the following hypotheses: 

- compound treatment increases the spiking rate;
- compound treatment decreases the spiking rate;
- compound treatment changes the spiking rate.

Test each hypothesis.
