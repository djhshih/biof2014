## Assessments

| type          | weight | derivation | programming |
|---------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| 15 quizzes    |  10%   |     Y      |             |
| 8 assignments |  60%   |     Y      |      Y      |
| 1 exam        |  30%   |     Y      |             |

Quizzes are your opportunity to practice for the exam.

You will be permitted to bring one double-sided A4 sheet of *hand-written* notes
to the exam. No calculator, computer, phone, or other electronic devices
are allowed in the exam.


## Marking

Lecturers' jobs are to teach.

Professors' jobs are to win grants and produce research outputs.

*No one* wants to do any marking.  
We get 0 credit for doing marking.  

\bigskip

Traditionally, exams are worth 50-100% of the final grade.

Grades *almost surely* (i.e. with probability = 1) will stay unchanged after
remarking, except in cases of adding error.

You are always welcome to ask questions about the *course content* or related
topics!


## Marking

Math is as objective as it gets.

Getting the final answer correct is *not* sufficient for full mark.

Rigor and clarity are just as important as the final answer.

\bigskip

Correct process $\Rightarrow$ correct final answer  (truth)

Incorrect final answer $\Rightarrow$ incorrect process  (contrapositive)

Correct final answer $\Rightarrow$ correct process (converse error)


## Marking

Why can't we just give everyone an A+?


## Lecture recording

Probably not feasible.


## ChatGPT

As per university policy, instructors should make assessments
'ChatGPT-proof'.

ChatGPT is excellent at writing meaningless fluff, and it is mediocre at logic.
It is often overfitted to the questions in the training set.

ChatGPT can be useful for correcting grammar, improving writing, and perhaps
as a second opinion.

ChatGPT does poorly (40-70%) on my questions for other courses.


## Notations

Learning and using the correct mathematical notation are critical!

Notations are invented to make expressions less ambiguous and more concise!

In the bioinformatics field, method descriptions are atrocious because few 
people learned the proper notations, which make communications very difficult.
