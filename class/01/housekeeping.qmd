## Schedule

Tuesdays & Thursdays 4:30 pm - 6:20 pm

Locations: MB217 or CPD-3.41


## Motivations

I have had little formal training in math at the university level
(1 year calculus + 0.5 year linear algebra) and no statistics.

In graduate school, I wanted to take statistics but the course instructor did
not grant permission.

Learning mathematical statistics by yourself is very difficult.

The bioinformatics curriculum needed a new statistics course, and I could 
have just declined to teach this course.

Statistical modelling is *very* useful in bioinformatics, but 
many bioinformaticists don't have a solid foundation in statistics and
statistics can take a long time to learn.

My goal: Provide a solid foundation for you to develop and use statistical 
models effectively.


## Comparison

|  course  | theory  | calculation | derivation | programming |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| STAT2601 | extensive | extensive | extensive | none      |
| BIOF2014 | extensive | minimal   | extensive | extensive |

### Course philosophy

We will cover the most useful mathematical concepts
that are useful for statistical modeling of real-world data.

Mathematics is how we communicate with one another about our models.

Programming is how we communicate with machines to do calculations.

## Assessments

| type          | weight | derivation | proof | programming |
|---------------|--------|------------|-------|-------------|
| 12 quizzes    |  10%   |     Y      |   ?   |      N      |
| 8 assignments |  60%   |     Y      |   Y   |      Y      |
| 1 exam        |  30%   |     Y      |   Y   |      N      |

Quizzes are your opportunity to practice for the exam.

Exam questions are similar to derivation and proof questions in 
the quizzes and the assignments.

You will be permitted to bring one double-sided A4 sheet of *hand-written* 
notes to the exam. No calculator, computer, phone, or other electronic devices
are allowed in the exam.


## Re-weighting

If your exam grade is higher than your overall grade for the quizzes
(or assignments), a weight of 10% will be shifted from the quizzes
(or assignments) to the exam.

| scenario                         | quizzes | assignments | exam |
|----------------------------------|---------|-------------|------|
| default                          |   10%   |     60%     |  30% |
| assignments $\ge$ exam > quizzes |    0%   |     60%     |  40% |
| quizzes $\ge$ exam > assignments |   10%   |     50%     |  40% |
| exam > max(quizzes, assignments) |    0%   |     50%     |  50% |


## Lecture recording

Probably not feasible.


## ChatGPT

As per university policy, instructors should make assessments
'ChatGPT-proof'.

ChatGPT is excellent at writing meaningless fluff, and it is mediocre at logic.
It is often overfitted to the questions in the training set.

ChatGPT can be useful for correcting grammar, improving writing, and perhaps
as a second opinion.

ChatGPT does poorly (40-70%) on my questions for other courses.

ChatGPT answers are often vague. They also lack mathematical rigor.


## Marking

Lecturers' jobs are to teach.

Professors' jobs are to win grants and produce research outputs.

*No one* wants to do any marking.

\bigskip

Traditionally, exams are worth 50-100% of the final grade.

Grades *almost surely* (i.e. with probability = 1) will stay unchanged after
remarking, except in cases of adding error.

You are always welcome to ask questions about the *course content* or related
topics!


## Marking

Why can't we just give everyone an A+?

What are the consequences when competency and reward are de-coupled?


## Marking scheme

Math is as objective as it gets.

Getting the final answer right is *not* sufficient for full mark.

Rigor and clarity are just as important as the final answer.

All questions must be answered with *mathematical rigor*.

\bigskip

Correct process $\Rightarrow$ correct results  (fact)

Incorrect results $\Rightarrow$ incorrect process  (contrapositive)

Correct results $\Rightarrow$ correct process (converse error)


## Marking scheme

### Derivation and programming questions

| Process                     | Result    |  Mark  |
|-----------------------------|-----------|--------|
| Correct                     | Correct   | 100%   |
| Correct but incomplete      | Null      | 10-90% |
| Mostly correct with errors  | Correct   | 40-80% |
| Mostly correct with errors  | Incorrect | 20-60% |
| Incorrect                   | Correct   | 0-20%  |
| Incorrect                   | Incorrect | 0%     |


## Marking scheme

### Proofs

| Process                                   | Result |  Mark  |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Correct and well-justified                | Given  | 100%   |
| Correct and well-justified but incomplete | Given  | 10-90% |
| Correct without sufficient justification  | Given  | 10-60% |
| Correct with wrong justification          | Given  | 0-30%  |
| Incorrect                                 | Given  | 0%     |


## Marks for humility

"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know
for sure that just ain't so."  â€“ Mark Twain

For each assignment question, you can get 1 mark for writing 
"I don't know", provided that all the following conditions hold:

a. "I don't know" is the entirety of your answer
b. the question is worth more than 1 mark
c. the question is *not* a bonus question
d. your assignment is submitted on time

The same applies to the exam.


## Late submissions

The penalty for late submission is 10% per day.

Quizzes or assignments will *not* be graded after any answer is discussed or
released.

Answers to quizzes are released at 8 a.m.\ 7 days after the quiz is open.


## Notations

Learning and using the correct mathematical notation are critical!

Notations are invented to make expressions less ambiguous and more concise!

In the bioinformatics field, method descriptions are atrocious because few 
people learned the proper notations, which make communications very difficult.
