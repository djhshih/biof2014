## Problem

You are performing an *in vitro* transcription assay, and you measure
the number of RNA molecules produced in multiple experiments, each with
different recording time intervals.

You record the following results using cell line A:

| time interval (min) | number of RNA molecules |
|:-------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|         1           |            6            |
|         1           |            8            |
|         1           |            2            |
|         2           |           11            |
|         2           |           14            |
|         3           |           14            |
|         3           |           17            |

What is the transcription rate in
terms of number of RNA molecules transcribed per minute?

You performed the experiment again after treating the cells with
a compound.

| time interval (min) | number of RNA molecules |
|:-------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|         1           |            1            |
|         2           |            3            |
|         4           |            6            |
|         5           |            9            |


## Tasks

1. Implement a quantification model in [Stan][1] to estimate
   the posterior distribution of the transcription rates in
   before and after compound treatment.

2. Derive the posterior distribution of the transcription rates
   before and after compound treatment.
   
3. What effect does the compound have?
