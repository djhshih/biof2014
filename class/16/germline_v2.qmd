There are many types of variants that can occur in the DNA. We will focus on the simplest
and most abundant type of variants known as **single-nucleotide variants** (SNV), which
involves the change of a single nucleotide in the DNA (e.g. A>T, G>A).

In SNV calling, we are only interested in positions with a alternative 
alleles, the input to the mutation calling model would be the reads and their
quality scores at selected positions. 

The bioinformatic tool `bcftools` implements a simple statistical model for 
SNV calling, as detailed in [Li 2011][1]. Let's derive a Bayesian model for SNV calling.

### Data

The data consists of the read $j \in \{1 \ldots J \}$ that overlap 
with a specific genomic position $l$. Our model will analyze each 
genomic position separately, so we will omit index $l$ from our model. 

$X_j$ represents an observed random variable indicator for whether 
read $j$ contains the  alternative allele at the base that 
aligns to genomic position $l$. 
If read $j$ contains the alternative allele, $X_j = 1$;
otherwise, $X_j = 0$. Let $\mathbold{X} = [X_j]$ be the vector
of read indicators.

$e_j \in [0, 1]$ represents the probability of read error for read $j$ 
at the base that aligns to position $l$. We treat $e_j$ as an known
fixed value.


### Haploid model

Our goal is to infer the unknown genotype $G$ at position $l$.
Let's first consider a simple haploid model.
Let $m$ represent the ploidy (i.e. the total number of alleles).

We define the unknown random variable $G = 0$ if the genotype is reference,
and $G = 1$ if the genotype is alternative.

The likelihood is
$$
\begin{aligned}
p \left( x_j \mid G = 0 \right) 
\; &= \;
\begin{cases}
1 - e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 0 \\
e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 1
\end{cases}
\quad &&= \; (1 - e_j)^{1 - x_j} e_j^{x_j} 
\\
p \left( x_j \mid G = 1 \right) 
\; &= \; 
\begin{cases}
e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 0 \\
1 - e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 1
\end{cases}
\quad &&= \; e_j^{1 - x_j} (1 - e_j)^{x_j} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the reads are independent,
$$
p \left( \mathbold{x} \mid g \right) = \prod_j p \left( x_j \mid g \right) .
$$

Let's start with an uniform prior:
$$
p \left( g \right) = \frac{1}{2} .
$$


### Diploid model

Indeed, many organisms including humans are diploid. So, let's derive a SNV 
calling model for diploids ($m = 2$).

At position $l$, let $G \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ represent the diploid genotype;

- $G = 0$ for homozygous reference
- $G = 1$ for heterozygous
- $G = 2$ for homozygous alternative

The homozygous genotypes have the same likelihoods as in the corresponding
genotypes under the haploid model:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p \left( x_j \mid G = 0 \right) 
\; &= \;
\begin{cases}
1 - e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 0 \\
e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 1
\end{cases}
\\
p \left( x_j \mid G = 2 \right) 
\; &= \; 
\begin{cases}
e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 0 \\
1 - e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 1
\end{cases} .
\end{aligned} 
$$

As for the heterozygous genotype, observing the reference allele
is equal probable to observing alternative allele. Therefore,
$$
p\left( x_j \mid G = 1 \right)
\; = \; 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2} & \text{ if } x_j = 0 \\
\frac{1}{2} & \text{ if } x_j = 1
\end{cases} .
$$

A uniform prior on $G \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ would be
$$
p \left( g \right) = \frac{1}{3} .
$$


### General model

Let's extend our model to support any ploidy $M = 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$

We now define $G \in \{0, \ldots M\}$ more generally as the number of 
copies of the alternative alleles at a specific position $l$ in the genome.

To help us think through the problem, we introduce a **latent**
(i.e. unknown and unobserved) random variable $Z_j$ that represents whether
read $j$ truly correspond to the alternative allele. The **observed**
random variable $X_j$ represents whether read $j$ is observed to correspond
to the alternative allele, and $Z_j$ represents the unknown underlying truth.

Similar to the haploid model, if we know $Z_J$, then,
$$
\begin{aligned}
p \left( x_j \mid Z_j = 0 \right) 
\; &= \;
\begin{cases}
1 - e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 0 \\
e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 1
\end{cases}
\\
p \left( x_j \mid Z_j = 1 \right) 
\; &= \; 
\begin{cases}
e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 0 \\
1 - e_j & \text{ if } x_j = 1
\end{cases} .
\end{aligned} 
$$

Applying the rules of probability,
$$
\begin{aligned}
p \left( x_j \mid g, m \right) 
&= \sum_{z_j \in \{0, 1\}} p \left( x_j, z_j, g, m \right)
   &\quad ( \text{justification?} ) \\
&= \sum_{z_j \in \{0, 1\}} 
   p \left( x_j \mid z_j \right) p \left( z_j \mid g, m \right)
   &\quad ( \text{justification?} )
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, we need to derive $p \left( z_j \mid g, m \right)$.

Similar to the haploid model, $p \left( z_j \mid g , M = 1 \right)$ 
is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 0, M = 1 \right) = 1 
\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 0, M = 1 \right) = 0 \\
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 1, M = 1 \right) = 0
\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 1, M = 1 \right) = 1 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar to the diploid model, $p \left( z_j \mid G , M = 2 \right)$ 
is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 0, M = 2 \right) = 1 
\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 0, M = 2 \right) = 0 \\
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 1, M = 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2}
\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 1, M = 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \\
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 2, M = 2 \right) = 0
\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 2, M = 2 \right) = 1 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Do you recognize the pattern?
$$
\begin{aligned}
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 0, M = 3 \right) = 
\quad\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 0, M = 3 \right) =  \\
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 1, M = 3 \right) = 
\quad\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 1, M = 3 \right) =  \\
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 2, M = 3 \right) = 
\quad\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 2, M = 3 \right) =  \\
p\left( z_j = 0 \mid G = 3, M = 3 \right) = 
\quad\quad\quad &
p\left( z_j = 1 \mid G = 3, M = 3 \right) =  .
\end{aligned}
$$

After deriving $p(z_j \mid g, m)$ based on our
understanding of genetics, we can now derive a closed-form expression
for the likelihood $p \left( x_j \mid g, m \right)$.


## Questions

Suppose that we are doing germline variant calling on human whole genomes.

1. Is a uniform prior on $G$ appropriate? We know that a typical human
   genome differs from the reference genome at 4.1 to 5.0 million sites [2].
   We also know that the heterozygosity ratio is 1.36 - 1.73 [3].
2. Derive a general expression for $p(z_j \mid g, m)$.
3. Derive $p(x_j \mid g, m)$.
4. Derive $p(g \mid x, m)$.
5. Derive an maximum likelihood estimator for $g$.
6. Derive an maximum *a posteriori* estimator for $g$.
