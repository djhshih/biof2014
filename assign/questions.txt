Lecture 5, joint, conditional, marginal

Given a discrete random vector $(X, Y)$, prove that $f_{Y \mid X} satisfies Kolmogorov's axioms 1 and 2.

Prove that $f_{Y \mid X}(y \mid x) = f_Y(y)$ .

Consider the inequality
$$
P\left( Y = y \mid X = x_1 \right) > 
 P\left( Y = y \mid X = x_2 \right) .
$$
Show that this inequality implies that $X \perp Y$.
